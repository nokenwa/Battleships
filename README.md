# Battleships - Term 2 Intro to Programming Project

## Variables & if statements

### Baseline (4 marks)

- [ ] Basic program with setup and draw

### Basic (max 2 marks)

- [ ] At least 1 variable
- [ ] At least 1 if statement
- [ ] Several variables

### Advanced (max 2 marks)

- [ ] Nested if statements
- [ ] Boolean variables
- [ ] Complex boolean conditions

## Loops

### Baseline (4 marks)

- [ ] Your program uses ar lease one basic loop

### Basic (max 2 marks)

- [ ] Many loops
- [ ] Nested loop
- [ ] Using the loop variable

### Advanced (max 2 marks)

- [ ] Non-standard loop (e.g. backwards) 
- [ ] Searching or otherwise breaking out of loops with break or return
- [ ] While loop

## Arrays

### Baseline (4 marks)

- [ ] Your program uses at least one basic array

### Basic (max 2 marks)

- [ ] Loops with arrays
- [ ] Functional programming (map, filter, reduce, etc)
- [ ] Arrays of objects

### Advanced (max 2 marks)

- [ ] 2D arrays
- [ ] Random access of arrays
- [ ] Random insertion/splicing arrays

## Functions

### Baseline (4 marks)

- [ ] Your program uses ar least one function defined by you

### Basic (max 2 marks)

- [ ] Most of your code is in your own functions not draw, setup etc 
- [ ] Parameterised functions  
- [ ] Return values

### Advanced (max 2 marks)

- [ ] Anonymous functions
- [ ] Functions that return different things depending on conditions or use conditions to return at different points in the function 
- [ ] Passing functions as arguments

## Objects/classes 

### Baseline (4 marks)

- [ ] Your program uses at least one object

### Basic (max 2 marks)

- [ ] Your objects have functions attached
- [ ] Use of classes or constructors
- [ ] Parameterised functions

### Advanced (max 2 marks)

- [ ] All of the functionality relating to your objects is functions attatched to the object 
- [ ] Almost all of the functionality of the program is in objects 
- [ ] A design involving many objects that interact with eachother

# Bonus
